# Personal and academic project üéì

- **Bayesian Statistics Project** - [Github](https://github.com/Zaltarba/Bayesian_statistics_project.git) - *2023*  
The aim of this project is to group a set of time series into clusters, and to estimate the model describing each cluster. Based on the folowing [article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4756297_Model-Based_Clustering_of_Multiple_Time_Series). More about it in [this post](https://zaltarba.github.io/blog/BayesianArticle/).

- **Hidden Markov Models Project** - *2022*  
Study of the article "A closed-form filter for binary time series", published by Fanaso and al. in 2021.
The aim of this project is to study and benchmark the performance of the "Optimal Particle Filter", which is
presented in Section 4.2 of the article, with the well-known Bootstrap Filter algorithm. More about it in [this post](https://zaltarba.github.io/blog/HiddenMarkov/).

- **Hackathon with Ostrum Asset Management** - *2022*  
First prize for the ESG topic, focusing on the influence of companies' carbon footprints on their default risk  

- **Applied statistics project with Agence France Locale** - *2020/2021*  
Production of descriptive statistics on French communes for the AFL barometer, identifying financial trajectories followed between 2014 and 2019 with clustering

- **Movie recommendation algorithm with Python** - *2020*  
Prediction of MovieLens database users' tastes by methods including clustering (k-means), PCA, matrix factorization using numpy, pandas, scipy libraries
