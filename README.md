## Personal and academic project üéì

- **Bayesian Statistics Project** - [Github](https://github.com/Zaltarba/Bayesian_statistics_project.git) - *2023*  
The aim of this project is to group a set of time series into clusters, and to estimate the model describing each cluster. Based on the folowing [article](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4756297_Model-Based_Clustering_of_Multiple_Time_Series). More about it in [this post](https://zaltarba.github.io/blog/BayesianArticle/).

Study of the article "A closed-form filter for binary time series", published by Fanaso and al. in 2021.
The aim of this project is to study and benchmark the performance of the "Optimal Particle Filter", which is
presented in Section 4.2 of the article, with the well-known Bootstrap Filter algorithm. More about it in [this post](https://zaltarba.github.io/blog/HiddenMarkov/).
